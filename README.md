# Block Panic!

## About

Automatic transport system of a nutsy factory has broken down and it's your job to
manually control the thing so that the production line would not stall!

This minigame is a game where you control the cart to catch the falling blocks and
dump them into one of the two conveyors located on left and right end of the track.
Blocks are falling from three ports on the ceiling. Can you keep the production keep
going without fail?


## How to play

- Up/Down: Choose difficulty on the title screen
- Enter: Set difficulty and play the game
- Left/Right: Control the cart
- Three rooms on your cart, three lives

Out of two conveyors, only one of them are open, and there's delay between the transition.
A spark moving toward left/right indicates when the shutter will be opening. You must not
let your focus slip as between transition, __no conveyor will be opened!__ And you can hold
up to __three__ blocks on your bucket.

You can make up to two mistakes. If you screw up three times, you are fired!

### Some rants about my univ

Yes, we teach C as 101, and we don't have any lecture that teaches you Python. ~~pretty shitty, eh?~~
On the contrary, we're actually asked to make a minigame as an assignment. ~~pretty cool, eh?~~
